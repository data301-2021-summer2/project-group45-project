## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

ASD is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behaviour. There are many factors that are likely the influences causes of ASD and those include the environmental, biological, and genetic factors. Gut microbiota in our body can stimulate multiple endocrines, neurocrines, and immunological signals to the brain and vice versa (microbiota-gut-brain axis). Modulating the gut microbiota can impact emotional behavior, such as anxiety, depression, and pain. For that, the gut microbiota can be the therapeutic potential for psychiatric disorders and many others. Based on the accumulating evidence of ASD shows that gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as gaseous, diarrhea, and constipation, often co-occurred with ASD core symptoms in children with ASD (Dan et al., 2020). For that, I wanted to explore the differences of main bacteria colonies present in the gut microbiome in individuals with ASD and in typically developing individuals (non-ASD). And, what are the main bacteria species of the gut microbiota that can be the potential driver species responsible for ASD. 


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data of the composition of the human gut microbiome of the children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was provided by Alexey Kotlik on www.kaggle.com which was the dataset from a research paper called "Altered gut microbial profile is associated with abnormal metabolism activity of Autism Spectrum Disorder" by Dan et al. The dataset is about the microbial genus and species that are present in the gut of ASD individuals (columns with AXX, where XX is a subject's ID number in the group) and typically developing individuals (columns with BXX, where XX is a subject's ID number in the group)which were recruited in May 2016 to August 2017. The purpose of the dataset was for learning as well as transparency/accountability. The fecal metabolites samples were collected by humans and the data was collected through different processes called Metagenomics that measured the 16S rRNA and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) which all of those are based on the historical records digitalized. Those process helps to evaluate the microorganisms that make up the community.
