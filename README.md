## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

ASD is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behaviour. There are many factors that are likely the influences causes of ASD and those include the environmental, biological, and genetic factors. Gut microbiota in our body can stimulate multiple endocrines, neurocrines, and immunological signals to the brain and vice versa (microbiota-gut-brain axis). Modulating the gut microbiota can impact emotional behavior, such as anxiety, depression, and pain. For that, the gut microbiota can be the therapeutic potential for psychiatric disorders and many others. In this project, I wanted to explore the differences of the main bacteria colonies present in the gut microbiome in individuals with ASD and in typically developing (non-ASD) individuals as well as to determine what are the main bacteria species of the gut microbiota that can be the potential driver species responsible for ASD. 


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data of the composition of the human gut microbiome of the children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was provided by Alexey Kotlik on www.kaggle.com which was the dataset from a research paper called "Altered gut microbial profile is associated with abnormal metabolism activity of Autism Spectrum Disorder" by Dan et al. The dataset is about the microbial taxonomy that are present in the gut of Typically Developing (TD) individuals (columns with AXX, where XX is a subject's ID number in the group) and ASD individuals (columns with BXX, where XX is a subject's ID number in the group), the number present under those AXXs and BXXs columns are the number of bacteria abundance for each species of the taxonomy column. The taxonomy shows the Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. The readings of each OTU or Operational Taxonomic Units were collected according to the 16S rRNA data from TD and ASD children that were recruited in May 2016 to August 2017. The purpose of the dataset was for learning as well as transparency/accountability.
